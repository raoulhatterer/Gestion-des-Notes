In your Termux application execute:

apt update

And then:

apt upgrade

pkg install mariadb

start the MySQL daemon (this should also be done if we restart the phone).

To do this, execute:

mysqld_safe -u root &

What we do is run mysqld_safe with the root user; the ampersand & is to run it in the background.
Run it and press Enter.
