In your Termux application execute:

apt update

And then:

apt upgrade

pkg install mariadb

start the MySQL daemon (this should also be done if we restart the phone).

To do this, execute:

mysqld_safe -u root &

What we do is run mysqld_safe with the root user; the ampersand & is to run it in the background.
Run it and press Enter.

Stop MySQL/MariaDB process
If you want to stop the process, find the ID from whichever process that has the word “mysql” using ps with grep, and then kill them with kill -9 [ID], the -9 is to send a KILL SIGNAL.

If you take a  look, they are two processes with 15406 and 15488 ids. The third is from grep but we omit it. Remember that it will change in your case because the process id isn’t always the same.

When you have the IDs kill them:

kill -9 15406

kill -9 15488
